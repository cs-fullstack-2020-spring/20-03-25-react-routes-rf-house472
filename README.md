# 20-03-25-React-Routes-rf
React Routes - Morning rapid fire/lecture repo

- Create a new react app called `react-router-app`
- Create a top level `AppContainer` component
- Create a child component called `AboutMe` that renders some generic content 'About' you
- Create a second child component called `Projects` that renders some generic content about the mini-project we did earlier

The `AppContainer` component should have a welcome message as an `<h1>` and using `Router` add `Link` elements to `Home` and the `AboutMe` and `Projects` content

Using `Router` add `Route` elements `/aboutme` and `/projects` that will route to each child component
